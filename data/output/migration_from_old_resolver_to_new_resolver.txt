Title: Migration from old resolver to new resolver

Hello!
I registered for an ENS domain back in 2018. I was busy with life and forgot about it; so I missed the ENS registry migration.
I can’t press the migrate button in the ENS manager, even though I’m logged in via metamask. I also can’t set the resolver, as it says I am not the controller (but i am?).
What can I do?
Thanks!
