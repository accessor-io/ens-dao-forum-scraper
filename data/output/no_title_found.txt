My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: Governance will make or break this whole show. Decentralized governance has little precedent. The discussion about issuing tokens based on wallet versus domains showed how difficult it is to find consensus. I can help.
My view on each section of the proposed ENS Constitution 902
Name ownership shall not be infringed: Agree
Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism: Agree. But primarily implies there are other reasons so we need to be consistent and specific.
Income funds ENS and other public goods: Agree.
ENS Integrates with the global namespace: Agree.
My web3 qualifications / skills: This world needs some logic, contract and governance experience. I have a law degree and a license. I own some NFTs and have used Alchemy and Buildspace to deploy smart contracts (Ropsten and Rinkeby testnets only). Web3 also needs some emotional intelligence and empathy and I have loads of those.

My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: For a project to succeed, support from its community is key. In an ideal world, everyone would self-delegate and vote in accordance to their own views for every proposed constitution, but this often isn’t the case. The reason that I want to be a delegate is to keep those who for whatever reason may not self-delegate informed and in the loop so that ultimately their votes really do represent their own views (or they revert to self-delegation or find someone else).
My view on each section of the proposed ENS Constitution


Name ownership shall not be infringed:  Agree, as stated in the proposal, for fairness.


Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism:  Disagree. I believe that the fee’s only purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund ongoing development and improvement of ENS. I also believe that a fee high enough for people to prevent speculative registrations will make ENS inaccessible for some others.


Income funds ENS and other public goods:  Disagree. ENS governance should only use the funds to support projects that will further the development and improvements of the ENS system.


ENS Integrates with the global namespace:  Agree.

I am currently working on a multichain + multiwallet tool as a dev lead.

ENS name: Jeff.eth
My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: Longtime ENS user and advocate.  Feel that I will do a good job of protecting the less tangible but still valuable parts of the ENS community’s culture (https://twitter.com/technocrypto/status/1455328006860386307).
My view on each section of the proposed ENS Constitution

Name ownership shall not be infringed: (Agree/Disagree/Comment)

Being completely frank, this provision is poorly worded and will definitely result in conflict/disagreement at some point (it already has if you poke around actually).  But I think the underlying principles motivating this provision are promising, if we can articulate them better.
First, for ENS names to be useful at all the behaviour and usability of an ENS name has to be predictable and we have to have a consensus about that behaviour that has a high degree of legitimacy and legibility.  For better or worse, the existing expectation of many people in the Ethereum ecosystem is that once you designate a single private key (or set of private keys) to control a record, that key has to sign off on any future changes to the record. If you lose the key, too bad. It’s seen as a “harsh but fair” approach.  But even this consensus has a lot of caveats. Mostly these caveats are about ways that a community, smart contract architect, etc. sets the expectations of the users up front.  In the case of ENS names, take expiry. Expiry has been part of the ENS plan from the beginning, and because this has been communicated clearly there is a shared expectation and consensus on the part of most ENS users that this is an acceptable infringement on their “absolute right” of ownership. Or, what happens when there is a bug in the auction process? Maybe some auctions have to be restarted, which is a sort of infringement. But not doing so would infringe on other types of ownership. So I get what this point is trying to say but at the least the word “absolute” is a poor fit here.
Another principle that definitely seems to be intended by this provision is to protect and maintain the credible neutrality of the ENS infrastructure itself. ENS already has a very wide userbase and set of stakeholders, and this credible neutrality is a key part of how all these different users, with their many (and sometimes conflicting) goals/needs can all agree to share one ENS system with its associated standards, tooling, integrations, and so on. But there is no such thing (or no such useful thing) as absolute neutrality. Even the credible neutrality of a system like ENS must of necessity embed some set of actual values to keep ENS worth anything at all to people.  These values include things like “what is a bug?” or “what constitutes a DoS attack?” and so on.  These values are mostly implicit in communities like this one, but they certainly exist. Not all of these values can be “enforced” but they must all “inform” certain decisions. A genuinely “true neutral” system is not actually useful.  You have to be good to everyone, not just neutral too them. And determining what that means hopefully involves some widely shared social consensus on what “good neutral” means, including how it changes in the light of new information (like changes in the Ethereum platform itself, or new technological capabilities that become available).
And finally, it is a technical fact, regardless of how the ENS registrar etc. are designed, that the ENS system is socially forkable. There are obvious and significant advantages to not forking the ENS system, not least of which is the degree to which many technical integrations with ENS have failed to correctly plan for this possibility.  But what we all collectively decide the ENS system is will have an enormous effect on the future usage and usefulness of any particular smart contract that forms a part of it. These means that we need to make a deliberate and ongoing effort to maintain positive and ongoing relationships between as many present and future stakeholders as possible.  Doing this well requires continuous communication around how ENS names are changing, problems that users are encountering, and so on.  Trust and goodwill are critical elements of a technical consensus. You can’t even conceive of an idea of “absolute ownership” of ENS name which would ignore these facts.
In summary, the thing I would want to protect as a delegate is the predictability, legitimacy, and legibility of the consensus around how ENS names work; the good and credible neutrality of the ENS architecture and system in how users and stakeholders are treated; and the positive social trust and goodwill which exists among the present and future set of ENS stakeholders.  And if someone can improve the phrasing of this section to better capture that, I’d happily vote for that version of the text. If not, that’s what I take this text to be trying to say, if somewhat poorly.

Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism: (Agree/Disagree/Comment)

This is clearly the existing social consensus around the ENS architecture. ENS is first and foremost a public service, NOT a for profit enterprise. Any divergence from this plan would be substantial:  very large issues would have to be at stake to ever consider changing this part of ENS in my view.

Income funds ENS and other public goods: (Agree/Disagree/Comment)

Again, in broad terms I think this is the existing consensus of what current and future funds are intended for.  Developing and supporting a healthy ENS ecosystem first, and then secondarily supporting the broader social and technical ecosystem on which the health of ENS also depends.

ENS Integrates with the global namespace: (Agree/Disagree/Comment)

The relationship of ENS with global namespaces like DNS is also fairly well established, if incompletely specified in a couple of cases.  But again the way of relating to and integrating DNS has been well established and public for some time, so it would take a very substantial issue being at stake for this general viewpoint to be seriously altered, in my view (example: a major change in how DNS is actually used worldwide).
My web3 qualifications / skills:
Incorrigible amateur and interferer in more serious technical engineering. Code literate, security aware, and familiar with most parts of the Ethereum and blockchain ecosystem, but probably not the person you want handwriting a critical bugfix under time pressure for real users.  More knowledgeable (albeit still not guaranteed to be useful) in the research department. A long track record of reviewing and analysing web3/Ethereum projects, typically at the design/conceptual/architectural level, though sometimes right down to the code. Knowledgeable enough to be dangerous about most technical things ![:slight_smile:](https://discuss.ens.domains/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9) Bitcoin since 2010 and Ethereum since before crowdsale.

ENS name: metaphor.xyz
My reasons for wanting to be a delegate:
At Metaphor, we have experience building products on top of the ENS protocol, and believe it is a foundational block providing identity to the web3 ecosystem. We want to provide a voice in the governance community for the protocol for initiatives that improve user experience and make it easier for users and developers alike to use and build on top of ENS.
My view on each section of the proposed ENS Constitution

Name ownership shall not be infringed: Agree

Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism: Agree

Income funds ENS and other public goods: Agree, and we think those other public goods should be geared toward improving web3 identity to provide wider access to the ecosystem for a larger class of users.
ENS Integrates with the global namespace: Agree, for the near term. We do think it’s worthwhile to discuss what happens when web3 has enough influence such that DNS is no longer significantly more embedded than a protocol like ENS, and how we can provide a wider namespace at that point without conflicting with DNS necessarily.

My web3 qualifications / skills:
Metaphor is a company/community (seeking to gradually become a DAO) that is making it crazy easy to join and participate in DAOs, with the idea that DAOs will be how the grand majority of users onboard into the web3 ecosystem as a whole.
Our product portfolio includes davatar (https://davatar.xyz/), the first app to make it easy to set your ENS avatar in a few clicks, with gas-less updates. We also, as part of that launch, released @davatar/react (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@davatar/react): the first helper library for React to implement the full ENS avatar spec. It makes it really easy for developers to add ENS avatars to their apps, and is used by apps such as Uniswap.
We have experience not only building products that are easy for any user to use in web3, but specifically on top of ENS. As such, we know very well the pain points that developers and users face when interacting with the ENS ecosystem, and have a lot of ideas on how we can improve them.
If you delegate to us, we will throw our weight and priority behind proposals and projects that we believe will improve the usability of ENS with respect to developers and users, with the aim that ENS should become the username for the new web.

ENS may need to make changes to the registration system to maintain an orderly/useful namespace - for example introducing a Harberger tax or other mechanism to allow for evicting squatters.
