Been in the Web2 space for many moons. Spent the entire year this year diving deep into web3 and smartcontracts. Built a small army of developers on discord (blockhead devs) and have been pushing the learning and building of blockchain things. Deep in the discords (all of them it seems like) and actively working to help push the boundaries of what the blockchain and web3 will do for our society and our planet.

Becoming a delegate is a meaningful role to take on. I see delegation as a necessary component of democratization. Contributing to this DAO through delegating is something that needs to be done given the mission of ENS. The mission of ENS is about proof of identity and digital freedom. Lets cooperate to build the metaverse!

I am an environmental tokenomist who was saved by web3 and started developing smart contracts that are built to detect Pigou and Coase externalities through NFTs and. I am currently working on a DAO for a slow-fashion initiative. In my free time I try to find ways to optimize smart contracts platforms by introducing quantum state consensus. I believe we need to anticipate emerging technology together so we can integrate early to thrive as a community.

ENS name: juliawu.eth
My reasons for wanting to be a delegate:
Having purchased and used tons of off-chain domain names, I appreciate the importance of a well-governed, accessible and inclusive naming system. As web3 grows, I believe that ENS will continue to play a critical role in the naming/referencing of wallets, apps and websites. I would like to help shape the future of this important protocol.

My web3 qualifications / skills:
I love the intersection of computer science and economics (my fields of study at Brown University).
I taught myself Solidity while wrapping up college in 2017, and have since built over 10 crypto projects (https://www.juliawu.me/about/) while working full-time as an engineer at companies like Apple, won 3 defi hackathons and received $25k in prizes/funding for my side projects. Built my first NFT project in 2018 which got funded by Pioneer.app.
I also translated parts of the Ethereum whitepaper to Portuguese (2017) and have authored many crypto/fintech articles (https://hackernoon.com/u/juliawu) featured on the homepage of publications like HackerNoon, a tech blog with over 4M+ monthly readers.

My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: I am excited about the opportunities ENS opens up to simplifying user experience in the space and enhance trust, especially with respect to DeFi. As the DeFi sphere expands and matures we’re seeing that the degree of “trust” required between participants varies depending on which protocols you’re using. ENS offers a great way to bridge that trust and build reputation to access the full spectrum of opportunities available.

My web3 qualifications / skills: I have been contributing towards web3/ DeFi since 2016. I founded the Melon protocol in 2016 which later became known as Enzyme. Enzyme was the first DeFi protocol to decentralise its governance in February 2019 and move towards a DAO/Council model. After that, I created Avantgarde Finance which is building a service layer for DeFi. We are very interested in building features around ENS for Enzyme to simplify DeFi access such a vault sub-domains and other.

My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: I’ve been an exceptionally active member (https://twitter.com/boardroom_info/status/1409958893699145729?s=20) in DAO governance for a while now. To date I’ve cast over 140 votes (https://app.boardroom.info/voter/0xe2cc777d59b4d354ff1d55add7579726d04430c0) for various governance. I’ve been using ENS since 2017, and guide projects for which I consult to integrate it into their platforms. I look forward to participating in governance through ENS, and intend to remain up-to-date on ENS issues, the project’s growth, and the politics that may arise in this space.

I’m full-time crypto, and intend to remain such.
